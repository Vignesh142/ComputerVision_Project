## Projects Overview

### 1. Finger Counter
This project uses hand detection to count the number of fingers held up by the user. The application can recognize and display the count in real-time.

### 2. System Volume Controller
Using hand gestures, this project allows users to control the system volume. By recognizing specific finger positions, it adjusts the volume accordingly.

### 3. AI Virtual Dumbbell Reps Counter
A fitness application that counts the number of dumbbell reps using pose estimation. It detects the user's posture and movements to provide real-time feedback and counting.

### 4. AI Virtual Painter
An interactive application that lets users draw on the screen using their fingers. Hand tracking is utilized to detect finger movements and translate them into drawing actions.

### 5. Face Mesh
This project demonstrates real-time face mesh detection, which maps 468 landmarks on the user's face. It can be used for various applications such as augmented reality and facial recognition.

## Installation

To run these projects, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage
  Run the application:
   ```bash
   python file.py
   ```
